Summarizing this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Arj5zlUPG4&ab_channel=Simplilearn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Arj5zlUPG4&ab_channel=Simplilearn)
## Why Cloud Computing
* A good application required resources such as servers, storage, developers, a dedicated network, and application security
* However, with this many resources, there are drawbacks - the inital setup is very expensive and risky and if the number of users increases, you will have to buy more servers to keep up with the demand
* Both of these problems can be solved using cloud computing.
## What is Cloud Computing
* Cloud computing is a platform that provides access to computing resources over the internet, such as serverless computing, virtual machines, storage, etc.
* Cloud service providers actually have huge datacentres which have hundreds of servers, storage systems, and components critical to the organization's function - it's a secure location where a large amount of data is stored.
* It's these data centres to collect and use their data. Users can access any service based on their requirement. There are a number of services a user can use. Almost every cloud service uses a model of users only paying for the services they use and nothing else. There is no upfront payment needed to use these services, you are only paying for the time that you use them.
* Cloud computing is used for: machine learning and data analysis, data storage and backup, streaming media content, creating and testing applications, automating software delivery, and hosting web applications.
## What is Azure
* Azure is cloud computing platform and online portal provided by Microsoft to access and manage resources and services provided by Microsoft (its competitor is AWS).
* Launched on Feb 1, 2010, free to start and also provides pay per use model, 80% of fortune 500 companies use Azure services, supports multiple programming languages (C#, Node, Java, etc.), there are datacenters in 42 regions around the world.
Azure is both a platform as a service and infrastructure as a service.
## Azure Services
* Azure services are divided into 18 categories and contains more than 200 services: compute, networking, storage, IoT, migration, mobile, analytics, containers, AI + machine learning, integration, management tools, developer tools, security, databases, DevOps, media, identity, and web.
* Compute
    * Virtual machine - create Windows or Linux virtual machines of any configuration in a matter of seconds (easily configuration to add RAM, add storage, remove it, etc.)
    * Cloud service - users can create scalable applications within the cloud using the virtual machines, whose provisioning, load balancing, and health monitoring are handled by Azure post-deployment
    * Service fabric - service fabric simplifies microservice development and application lifestyle management (a microservice is an application that consists of smaller applications coupled together)
    * Functions - easily build applications using serverless functions in any programming language of the user's choice (you don't have to worry about hardware components, all of that is taken care of by Azure, you just need to provide the code to Azure, and it will execute it)
* Networking
    * Azure CDN (Content Delivery Network) - used for delivering high bandwidth content to users worldwide (this is actually a network of servers placed in strategic locations around the world so customers can obtain information as fast as possible)
    * Express route - lets on-premise networks into Microsoft cloud through a private connection
    * Virtual network - enables Azure resources to securely communicate with each other
    * Azure DNS - a hosting service that allows the user to host their DNS domains in Azure
* Storage
    * Disk storage - provides cost-effective HDD/SSD options which can be used with Azure Virtual Machines
    * Blob storage - optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data such as text or binary data
    * File storage - managed file storage in the cloud that are accessible via industry standard server message block (SMB) protocol
    * Queue storage - provides durable message queuing for large workloads and can be accessed from anywhere in the world
## Uses of Azure
* Azure can be used for:
    * Application development
    * Testing
    * Application hosting
    * Creating virtual machines
    * Integrating and syncing features
    * Collecting and storing metrics
    * Virtual hard drives (VHDs)
